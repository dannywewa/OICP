# Image Processing Tools

## OpenCV

It stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library. This library consists of around 2000+ optimized algorithms that are useful for computer vision and machine learning. There are several ways you can use opencv in image processing, a few are listed below:

* Converting images from one color space to another.
* Performing thresholding on images.
* Smoothing of images
* Performing morphological operations on images.
* Building image pyramids.
* Extracting foreground from images using GrabCut algorithm.
* Image segmentation using watershed algorithms.

## Scikit-image

It is an open-source library used for image preprocessing. It makes use of machine learning with built-in functions and can perform complex operations on images with just a few functions.

Some operations listed below:

* Thresholding
* Edge detection
* Gaussian smoothing
* Histogram equalization
* Rotate the image
* Rescale the image
* Apply morphological operations

## PIL/pillow

PIL stands for Python Image Library and Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and COntributors. It support a wide range of image formats like PPM, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, and BMP.

## Numpy

With this library you can also perform simple image techniques.

Images can represented by NdArrays.

## Mahotas

It is a computer vision and image processing library and has more than 100 functions.
